1- Flat File Structure:

- Stores data in one single table or spreadsheet-like format.

- Data is saved as plain text, often separated by commas or tabs.

- No built-in way to connect related data across different files.


2- Relational Database Structure:

- Stores data in multiple linked tables.

- Each table holds one type of entity (e.g., Customers, Orders).

- Uses Primary Keys and Foreign Keys to create relationships.



3- Key Difference in Flat Files: 
-  High redundancy. The same data (like customer info) must be repeated in every related record,    making updates inconsistent.

4- Relational Databases:
-  Low redundancy. Unique data is stored once and linked to other tables via keys, ensuring consistency.

5- When to Use Flat Files:
 - Simple, independent data with no complex relationships.

6- Databases:
- Complex, interrelated data where integrity and scalability matter.

7- Drawbacks Flat Files:


- High redundancy and inconsistency.

- Hard to manage large datasets.

- No data relationships.

- Poor multi-user control.

- Limited security.

8- Databases:

- More complex to set up and manage.

- Needs technical knowledge (SQL).

- Requires maintenance and resources.

- Higher initial cost.
